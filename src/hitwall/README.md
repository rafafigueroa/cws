hitwall
=====================

Basic ROS package to run the turtlebot. Move the hitwall directory inside an existing catkin workspace (inside the src directory) and make it as seen in class. 

The code was tested in simulation with:


ROS Hydro

Gazebo 1.9 with gazebo_ros_pkgs

turtlebot robot packages: http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TurtleBot

turtlebot simulator packages: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator


Also in ROS Groovy with the actual turtlebot 2 robot.

Code for reference only, intended for AMR classmates
